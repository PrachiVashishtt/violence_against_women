# In India, a Womanâ€™s Empowerment Is Dying at Home

## An analysis of the recent data reported by the National Family Health Survey 

This is my submission for the 2023 Lede Program's second project. 

### Goal
This project began with a curiosity to check the latest data available on domestic violence in India, and what it truly meant for the women in the country. 

### Findings
Through my analysis, I found that domestic violence doesn't only stem from an abusive partner, but other family members play an important role in it too. Women are often beaten and suffering behind closed doors, regardless of living in an urban setup. Additionally, I found that women in India do not seek help from the authorities in most cases. 

### Data collection
1. I spent days looking for pertinent information because so much of what I discovered was inaccurate, out-of-date, or unsupported by a reliable source. Finally, I was able to download a document from the government website that included information on sexual assault statistics in India as well as other crucial family statistics like income and education.
2. I then scrapped the data out of the pdf using Camelot but was unsuccessful. The data was finally scraped using Tabula. 

### Data Analysis:
1. In each dataset, I first cleaned the data and dropped the columns that were not serving my project.
2. Additionally, I sorted the data and put the not applicable data at the end of the table to ease my visualization process.
3. I also ensure that all the data was in a numerical form to sort it further. I used the to_numeric function in pandas for this.

### New skills
- Scraping, cleaning, and analyzing data in pandas 
- Dropping columns in pandas 
- to_numeric function
  
### What I couldn't do 
1. I wasn't able to use the Camelot function. I want to learn how to scrap data better.
2. I wasn't able to make an interactive graphic and stuck to Datawrapper. I aim to use more sophisticated tools next time and push my coding skills.

3. ### What I do next time 
1. I will manage the time between fetching data and analyzing and visualizing it. I will set better deadlines compared to this time.
2. I will make a scrolling, interactive project with more analyzed data.
