            <h6>July 9, 2023</h6>
            <p>
                While the home is a safe haven for many, recent National Family Health Survey data reveals that 28.7% of women in India experience physical violence through sources including family members. This report comes as women in India have been targeted with brutal attacks by their partners and family members, many of which have resulted in death.              </p>
                <p>In 2022, a woman in India was murdered by her father for marrying her partner without his approval. According to the reports, the 21-year-olds body was found stuffed in a bag. Recently, another horrific incident surfaced where a woman was murdered by her daughter after experiencing consistent domestic squabble with her. </p>
                </p>
                    Such incidents and data reveal that within the confines of a seemingly structured home in India, countless untold stories of shattered self-esteem and abandoned dreams lie in silence. </p>

            <h3>Perpetrators of Physical Violence: Unmasking the Faces  
                </h3>
            <p>
                78% percent of physical violence against women in India happens through their partners. Following this, mothers and fathers also contribute highly by conducting approximately 15% and 10% of the violence each. In fact, unmarried women in India report that the highest contributors to physical attacks are their fathers, mother, and siblings.  </p>

            <p>
                Data reveals that married women in India face sexual abuse mostly from their current husbands followed by their former partners and relatives. On the other hand, unmarried women report the highest sexual assault incidences to happen through their relatives. </p>

        <h3>Seeking Help: Where Does Lost Comfort Reside?
            </h3>
                <p>
                    Despite the danger, 73.2% of urban Indian women and 78.6% of rural Indian women never told anybody about their condition. When they finally find the strength to seek help, they first turn to their own family, followed by their husband's family and their friends.    </p>
            <p>
                Surprisingly, in India, women rarely approach authorities such as police, attorneys, and social service organizations. According to data, just 6% of women contact the police, and only about 2% contact lawyers or social service organizations. In such situations, one can only wonder: if not at home, then where should India's women turn for support?   <br><br>
